# Monte-Carlo-integration
Monte Carlo integration is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional integrals or integrals over complex, irregularly shaped domains where traditional methods may be impractical. It's widely used in various fields, including physics, finance, and engineering, for solving problems involving numerical integration.
